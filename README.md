## Abstract 
In this project, I designed an interactive web page for multiple users to log into their hotel account. A customer would be able to view prior room bookings, total dollars spent, and create a new booking based on availability. Additional options include selecting a specific room type.

As a manager, they would have the ability to view the number of available rooms for the current date, revenue for today and the percentage of rooms occupied for the day. Additionally, a manager would be able to search for a customer by name, view that clients booking history along with the total dollars spent for that specific customer.  A manager would also be able to add a new booking for any customer and delete upcoming booking requests.

This project will demonstrate understanding and implementation of ES6 classes, TDD and testing suites, HTML/CSS UX/UI design, ability to write modular, reusable code that follows SRP, using array prototypes for data manipulation, and the ability to follow spec/comp to complete a functional app.
